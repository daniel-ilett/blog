Ever since student project *Narbacular Drop* was adopted by Valve and spun into seminal puzzle-platformer *Portal* in 2007, the idea of mind-bending physics in games has captured the imaginations of players and developers alike; games that have followed it such as *Antichamber* and recent release *Manifold Garden* demonstrate that there is still unexplored space in the "brain-tickling physics" genre. The question I've always asked myself is: how could I create *Portal*'s portals from scratch?

This series will explore several complicated concepts: shaders, physics, maths. *Portal* isn't the only game to feature portals, of course - the first article will act as a taster and will feature a portal effect similar to classic *Spyro* - in those games, portals were, visually, just a glimpse at the skybox of another level. Then, we'll ramp things up and move onto constructing *Portal*-style portals piece by piece, starting with non-recursive portals seen in games like *Manifold Garden* and building up to recursion-based portals, as seen in *Portal*. I'll do my best to explain each step in full.

The posting schedule for this series is as follows:

**Part 1**: Spyro Skyboxes | [Out now!](https://danielilett.com/2019-12-11-tut4-1-spyro-skyboxes/) | `Spyro-style Portals`
**Part 2**: Portal Rendering | [Out now!](https://danielilett.com/2019-12-14-tut4-2-portal-rendering/) | `Camera Positioning`, `Stencil Rendering`
**Part 3**: Matrix Clipping | [Out now!](https://danielilett.com/2019-12-18-tut4-3-matrix-matching/) | `Oblique Near-Plane Projection`
**Part 4**: Portal Momentum | [Out now!](https://danielilett.com/2020-01-03-tut4-4-portal-momentum/) | `Physics`
**Part 5**: Placing Portals | [Out now!](https://danielilett.com/2020-01-12-tut4-5-placing-portals/) | `Raycasting`, `Rotations`
**Part 6**: Portal Recursion | [Out now!](https://danielilett.com/2020-01-19-tut4-6-portal-recursion/) | `Recursion`, `Screen-space Sampling`

As always, there is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/daniel-ilett/shaders-portal) for the series. Feel free to poke around while development is ongoing.
