Hello everyone, and welcome to this site! This is where I'll be hosting various game development tutorials, with a specific focus on shader programming. This site will be inextricably linked to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/danielilett) - if you enjoy the work I do, I'd be extremely grateful if you could pledge just a little a month to motivate me to keep creating tutorials and experimental games.

I'll aim to get around two posts out each week on a Wednesday and Saturday, subject to external deadlines. The first shader series will be coming very soon, so look out for that - I have a rough roadmap of posts I'd like to write in the upcoming months.

Also consider checking out my other accounts using the links found on the bottom of the page. I'll be hosting games on itch.io and writing about them here, and all tutorial code will be found on my GitHub account. I don't use Reddit and LinkedIn very much, but if you'd like to reach out to me to recommend a fellow creator or suggest an idea, you might be able to find me on there. I'm much more active on Twitter - feel free to send a Tweet my way.
