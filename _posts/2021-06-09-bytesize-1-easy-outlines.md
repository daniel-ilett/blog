There are a lot of approaches you can take to make outlines for 3D objects in Unity. Today, we're going to explore a time-tested, super easy approach for outlines, translated to Shader Graph!

{: .box-note}
Bytesize Gamedev is a series of shorter game development tutorials.

Hang out with me and other shader enthusiasts over on [Discord]((https://discord.gg/tPQEUwPpb3)) and share what you're working on! And check out this tutorial over on YouTube:

# Easy Outlines

We'll start by creating a new graph by right-clicking in the Project View and selecting *Create -> Shader -> Universal Render Pipeline -> Unlit Shader Graph* (or *Create -> Shader -> Unlit Graph* on older Unity versions).

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part1-create-shader.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Create Shader." title="We want an unlit shader because the outline should have a block colour.">
*We want an unlit shader because the outline should have a block colour.*

We can set the output colour to black. Or, you could make this into a property if you want.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part1-black-color.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Black Main Color." title="The outline will just be a single colour.">
*The outline will just be a single colour.*

Then we need to enable double-sided rendering. On older Unity versions, we use the drop-down cog menu on the master node. On newer versions, we just choose the Graph Settings. Either way, tick the "Two Sided" box.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part1-two-sided.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Two Sided Rendering." title="There's two sides to every story.">
*There's two sides to every story.*

Now we'll disable front-facing triangles so that only back-faces are visible. Add an `Is Front Face` node, then pass it into the **Predicate** input on a `Branch` node - the **True** and **False** inputs are 0 and 1 respectively. That gets passed into the **Alpha** field on the Master node, and the **Alpha Clip Threshold** is set to 0.5.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part1-remove-front.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Remove Front Faces." title="Pixels with alpha below Alpha Clip Threshold are deleted.">
*Pixels with alpha below Alpha Clip Threshold are deleted.*

Now we'll extend the shape of the mesh along its surface normals. Start by adding an `Outline Thickness` property - it's a `Float`/`Vector1`.

We'll take a `Normal Vector` node - in **Object** space - and `Normalize` it, so its length is 1. We can `Multiply` by `Outline Thickness`, then we'll `Add` all this to a `Position` node in **Object** space. This gives us a new position for the vertex, which gets output to the **Vertex Position** pin on the Master.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part1-extend-normals.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Extend Vertex Normals." title="This is normally the easiest way to add outlines.">
*This is normally the easiest way to add outlines.*

Attach a material using this shader to an object - as well as another material using your usual shader for the object - and here's the result:

*Pikachu looks so happy to be highlighted like this!*
