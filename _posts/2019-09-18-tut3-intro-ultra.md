Throughout May, I released [a series of image effect shaders]({% post_url 2019-04-24-tut1-intro-smo %}) aimed at emulating those found in Super Mario Odyssey's Snapshot Mode. It was met with a modest amount of traction - for the most part, people seemed happy with them! A few people starred the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/daniel-ilett/smo-shaders), a handful of comments got left on my [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bpc4qx/unity_shaders_nes_snes_game_boy_pixelation_and/) and people showed off [stuff they've done with the shaders](https://twitter.com/TheSarahChimera/status/1130235493919027200) on Twitter. Eventually, I spun the collection of Snapshot Mode shaders into an Asset Store package, aptly named [Snapshot Shader Collection](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/snapshot-shader-collection-146666). Never ask me to name anything.

The philosophy of the series was to take apart each effect and get to the fundamentals of how they worked - the maths behind each and the shader techniques required. I'd like to return to image effects, but rather than cleaning up the rest of SMO's shaders, I'll open this series up to effects not seen in the game. That means more variety!
