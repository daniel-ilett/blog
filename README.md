# Daniel Ilett - Gamedev | Shaders | Compsci
A Jekyll-powered blog site to host all my tutorial and blog content.

## Overview
This repository contains all the content used on my website and blog, [danielilett.com](https://danielilett.com). Much of the content includes tutorial series linked to my Patreon account; other content includes games I've released.

So far, the following series are live on the site:
- Image Effects - Super Mario Odyssey shaders.

## Software
This website is comprised of static webpages created using Jekyll. Each page is created using a combination of HTML and Markdown.

It uses the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme.

## Release
This iteration of the website went live on April 20th 2019, replacing the old site.

Thanks for taking an interest in my work.
