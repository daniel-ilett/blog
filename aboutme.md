I'm Daniel Ilett. My goal with this website is to pass on important knowledge about shaders and other gamedev topics in a format that's easy to grasp for beginners but also worthwhile for intermediate users. The site is a portfolio of sorts, demonstrating my ability to communicate abstract and difficult subjects to others. 

Here's a handful of things I do/did/am/was:

I'm a **PhD candidate** at the University of Warwick, working with **HDR video delivery** to mobile devices. The cutting edge of HDR on mobiles is HDR10 and I'm working on ways to deliver the maximum amount of dynamic range to devices capable only of LDR.

I graduated in 2018 with a first-class **Computer Science MEng** from Warwick after four long and enjoyable years!

In my time at Warwick, I've co-founded **Warwick Nintendo Society** and helped it become an official Warwick SU society, staying on the exec committee every year of its existence. I've climbed through the ranks of **Warwick Game Design Society**'s exec committee to become President for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years. And on top of that, I took up the role of **Warwick Pride**'s Social Media Officer in 2019.
