I'm Daniel Ilett. I make games. Here's a few fast facts about me:

- I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Warwick, working with HDR video delivery to mobile devices
- I graduated with a Computer Science MEng in 2018
- I started making games in 2013 and haven't stopped since
- I'm President of Warwick Game Design Society from 2018-present
- I co-founded Warwick Nintendo Society in 2014 - it became an official Warwick SU Society in 2017

I think that just about sums me up!
