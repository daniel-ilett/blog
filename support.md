title: Support Me
---

I'm supported by kind people like you! I'd like to keep this site ad-free and I write these tutorials on the side of my PhD work, so it would mean the world to me if you could consider supporting me on my **Patreon** or **Ko-fi** accounts!

# Patreon

**Patrons** will receive **PDF versions** of my articles if they pledge at least **$1** a month. Additionally, **$5+ backers** received each tutorial in my *Unity Tips* series a fortnight before everyone else. All articles eventually find their way onto this site for free; the PDFs are duplicates of existing articles for convenience offline.

# Ko-fi

If the idea of pledging money each month is off-putting for you, **Ko-fi** lets you give a one-off tip to the creators you want to support! Better still, **Ko-fi** takes *zero percent* of your pledge, unlike **Patreon**, which has platform fees. I'll use **Ko-fi** in a similar way to my **Patreon**: you'll get a small number of articles early and exclusive PDF copies of articles. All articles will make their way onto [danielilett.com](https://danielilett.com/).
