title: Support Me

I'm supported by amazing people like you! I'm able to keep the site free and keep publishing articles because of those who can donate, and if you can't, then every share on social media goes a long way too!

Lots of goodies are up for grabs on my Patreon, depending on the tier you choose - from early access and your name in the credits, all the way to bonus copies of my asset packs.

If you don't want to pledge every month, then maybe Ko-Fi is for you. If you really enjoyed one of my tutorials or videos and want to give a small contribution, then you can buy me approximately a coffee. Trust me, I appreciate the coffee!

# Email Newsletter

And of course, a great way to support the site is to stay on top of new articles. You can do that with good old-fashioned email!
