When working in Unity, it's a good idea to profile often. Whenever you come across a bottleneck in CPU or GPU usage, the **Profiler** is your best friend - it will tell you exactly which resources are being used by each part of the game, down to each function call. But what is the Profiler? What information does it provide? And what are the best practices for profiling your game? This article drills down each of the functions of the Unity Profiler and suggests ways to make effective use of the data it provides.

# What is Profiling?

Many software development environments provide tools for breaking down the most resource-intensive parts of the program - that process is known as 'profiling'. Unity ships with its own profiling tools, found under *Window->Analysis->Profiler*.
