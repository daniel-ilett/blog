Some games like [scribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/) have a cute sprite 'wobble' effect, with a two-frame animation. In this tutorial, we will implement that same effect in Shader Graph!

{: .box-note}
Bytesize Gamedev is a series of shorter game development tutorials.

By the way, I have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tPQEUwPpb3) for people who are making things using shaders! If you want to share something you've worked on, see what others are doing, ask questions about shaders or otherwise just wanna hang out with others who like shaders, come join us!

Also check out this tutorial on my YouTube channel maybe? Remember to subscribe too!

# Sprite Wobble

Start by creating a new Sprite Unlit graph via *Create -> Shader -> 2D Renderer -> Sprite Unlit Graph (Experimental)* - on newer Unity versions, this is *Create -> Shader -> Universal Render Pipeline -> Unlit Graph*.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part2-new-shader.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="New Shader." title="Gotta start somewhere.">
*Gotta start somewhere.*

We'll create four properties: `Main Texture`, a regular `Texture2D`; `Flow Map`, another `Texture2D`; `Strength`, a `Vector1`/`Float` with a default of `0.005`; and `Speed`, another `Vector1`/`Float` with a default of `4`.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part2-properties.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Properties." title="A few basic properties is all we need!">
*A few basic properties is all we need!*

Then we need a clock. I'm going to make mine use 4 frames of animation. Take a `Time` node's **Time** output, `Multiply` it by `Speed`, and then `Modulo` the result by 4. `Floor` that, then `Divide` by 4.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part2-clock.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Animation Clock." title="Better than TikTok.">
*Better than TikTok.*

That's going to become a UV offset. Funnel the clock result into a `Tiling And Offset` node's **Offset** pin, with the **UV0** channel in the **UV** input.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part2-uv-offset.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="UV Offset." title="This only works if your flow map is set to repeat!">
*This only works if your flow map is set to repeat!*

Connect the modified UVs to the **UV** input of a `Normal From Texture` node, with the `Flow Map` in its **Texture** slot. This will generate offset vectors for the 'wobble'. `Multiply` by `Strength`.

<img data-src="/img/bytesize/part2-flow-map.jpg" class="center-image lazyload" alt="Flow Map." title="You could alternatively use Strength in the Normal From Texture's input.">
*You could alternatively use Strength in the Normal From Texture's input.*

Add these offset vectors to a `UV` node, then use the result in the **UV** field on a `Sample Texture 2D` node. That node will be sampling the `Main Texture`. Then we can output its result to the Color field on the Master node, and we're done!
