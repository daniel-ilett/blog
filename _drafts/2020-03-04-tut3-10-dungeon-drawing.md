*Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon* evokes a lot of nostalgia from fans of the series. With *Rescue Team DX* releasing this Friday, it's a good time to break down the gorgeous hand-drawn effect used in the game. Today, we'll write an improved edge detection shader over the ones we've written before and then create a separate 'drawing' effect that makes the whole scene look like it's shaded with a pencil.
