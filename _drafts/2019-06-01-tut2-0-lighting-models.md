There are several lighting models used in 3D graphics. With the advent of realtime photorealistic rendering, we've seen more complex lighting than ever, and modern lighting systems mimic the way real light interacts with objects - this is called physically-based rendering. Ray-tracing, Nvidia's favourite buzzword of the day, simulates light as particles travelling in straight lines, bouncing off objects - hence, "ray-tracing". Today, we're going to look at some of the more traditional lighting models from a theoretical perspective; we'll build on and implement them throughout the series.

# Phong Shading

## Diffuse Light

## Specular Light

## Ambient Light

# Unity Surface Shaders

# Conclusion

You should have a solid understanding of the terms we'll be using throughout the rest of the series. Next article will kick off with a simple diffuse lighting shader; we'll be building two variants of the shader, one using conventional vertex and fragment shaders, and the other using Unity's special surface shaders.
