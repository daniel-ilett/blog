I recently played Manifold Garden, a game full of Escher-esque architecture. It's full of mind-blowing sequences, and one of my favourite technical elements was the game's portals, which are used heavily to explore the idea of impossible space. You walk into a small door, and there's a vast world on the other side. Today, we'll recreate this kind of portal.
