This tutorial explores the retro console shaders found in Snapshot Mode, which emulate the look and feel of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super NES (SNES), and Game Boy (GB). We will look into the colour transformations involved and implement an effect that makes the image appear as if it is being displayed on an old-style CRT screen.

# Conclusion

We've looked into some relatively simple shaders that only considered pixels one-at-a-time, but are more in-depth than the Greyscale shaders from before. Perhaps you now have more of an appreciation for the difference between CRT and LCD screens, too. In the next tutorial, we'll use a new type of kernel function to imitate the Oil Painting effect.
