Several games could be described as 'cinematic'. Usually, that means heavy application of film techniques to deliver the story or narrative of the game, although interpretations of the term differ - it's very subjective. It could mean throwing a film grain effect over the screen and using black bars to force the viewport into a wider aspect ratio. It might mean lots of cutscenes. And in this tutorial, we'll take it to mean the first - film grain and black bars! Many of these effects emulate the imperfections of cameras or photographic film, so today we're going to use a **noise function** to recreate the film grain effect.
