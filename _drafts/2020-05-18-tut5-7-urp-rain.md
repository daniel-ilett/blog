Games use weather effects to enhance the mood or atmosphere of a scene, or to reflect a realistic outdoor environment. The most common way of simulating weather effects such as rain is to use a combination of environment details, such as materials or lighting, and particle effects. In this tutorial, we're going to use a combination of these techniques to recreate a rain effect, using particles for the raindrops and a custom material for puddles on the ground. We'll use Shader Graph for the puddle material and take a first look at Visual Effect Graph for the rain particles.
