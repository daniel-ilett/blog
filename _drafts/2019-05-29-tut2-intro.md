There are many types of lighting model for adding character to your scene. Many modern games opt for a photorealistic style, attempting to mimic the way light behaves in the real world - techniques such as raytracing take this to the next level by actually simulating the way light refracts through, is absorbed by, and reflects off surfaces. But it's certainly not the only way to light your scene - many games gain a stronger sense of identity through highly stylised aesthetics, including cel-shading.

You might have heard cel-shading also referred to as "toon lighting" or simply a "cartoonish" style; it was popularised in the early-to-mid noughties by games such as *Jet Set Radio* and *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker*. The key to cel-shading is to modify the lighting of models such that there is at least one hard cut between lit and unlit sections. On top of that, it's common to either use block colours in your textures, or to add bold outlines around model geometry, or to bake strong outlines into the texture. We're going to take a look mostly at the base lighting ramp, plus fresnel/rim lighting and an outline, plus normal mapping.
