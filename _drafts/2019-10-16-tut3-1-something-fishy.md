Fisheye lenses gained popularity throughout the 1900s for their ability to capture ultrawide-angle views using a spherical papping, rather than conventional imaging which captures images with a straight-line perspective. The name comes from how American physicist Robert W. Wood imagined a fish would view the world underwater. Images created using a fisheye lens are characterised by objects in the centre appearing 'closer' than those on the edges. Nowadays, we use fisheye lenses for a range of applications, from artistic choices in entertainment media to computer graphics, where we can use two 180-degree virtual lenses to create environment maps. Today, we combine both of those use cases and look at a cheap way to convert conventional images into fisheye-style images: using computer graphics to achieve an artistic style.
