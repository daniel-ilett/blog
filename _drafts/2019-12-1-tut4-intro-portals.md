Ever since student project *Narbacular Drop* was adopted by Valve and spun into seminal puzzle-platformer *Portal* in 2007, the idea of mind-bending physics in games has captured the imaginations of players and developers alike; games that have followed it such as *Antichamber* and recent release *Manifold Garden* demonstrate that there is still unexplored space in the "brain-tickling physics" genre. The question I've always asked myself is: how could I create *Portal*'s portals from scratch?

This series will explore several complicated concepts: shaders, physics, maths. *Portal* isn't the only game to feature portals, of course - the first article will act as a taster and will feature a portal effect similar to classic *Spyro* - in those games, portals were, visually, just a glimpse at the skybox of another level. Then, we'll ramp things up and move onto constructing *Portal*-style portals piece by piece. I'll do my best to explain each step in full.
