A common trope in videogames is the infamous water level. All good games must have one - who can say whether Ocarina of Time would have been the critical and commercial success it was without the Water Temple? Games emulate the feeling of being underwater in several ways - from tinting the screen blue to emulating the way foliage waves around in the undercurrents. In this tutorial, instead of a full simulation of the water's effect on objects, we'll build on the work from last tutorial and mess with the UVs we use to sample the image texture, albeit in a different manner. We'll also look at how to create composite effects.

# Composite Effects

# Conclusion

Today we've seen how we can mess around with image UVs to achieve our effect in a surprisingly efficient manner. There are several other ways to create a fisheye lens effect, but I chose this one due to its ease of implementation and cheap computational cost. 

In the next tutorial, we'll look at an underwater effect, complete with animated waves. Additionally, we'll look at ways of combining multiple effects into a single package.
